    <p>Andre Drummond, Detroit Pistons "I'm definitely big on the 90s music. It's just kind of relaxing music. I make music myself, so I like to listen to a lot of my stuff. Rick Ross is one of my favorite rappers. A$AP Rocky as well." John Wall, Washington
      Wizards "Migos â€“ they've got it on lock right now. They're on fire." LaMarcus Aldridge, San Antonio Spurs "It's hard to pick. Jay-Z and Lil' Wayne are my all-time favorite artists. So I always listen to those guys." Paul George, Oklahoma City Thunder
      "A lot of Drake. Migos new album. I always represent West Coast. Nipsey Hussle. The Game. Jay-Z. Meek Mill. Rick Ross. Lil' Wayne. Those are my go-to guys right now. That's my go-to list." Bradley Beal, Washington Wizards "There's a lot of new stuff
      that's come out. Nipsey Hussle's really hot right now. I love the Migos, but I feel like 'Big Shot' by Kendrick Lamar is my go-to song right now. Migos' going to have the way for the next couple years, for sure." Anthony Davis, New Orleans Pelicans
      "I listen to everybody. Hip hop, R&B. Rick Ross. Lil' Wayne. I just got on G-Eazy. He's one of my favorite artists right now. I like Biggie a lot. Jay-Z." Victor Oladipo, Indiana Pacers "My go-to music is old school R&B. 2000s, 90s, 80s, and I might
      even sneak some 70s in there. I like a little bit of everybody, it just depends on how I'm feeling. I could go country one day, Rascal Flatts one day, but then the next day I might just go completely left and listen to Lil' Wayne. I'm very, very
      diverse, especially with music." Goran Dragic, Miami Heat "Serbian music. Aca Lukas is my favorite right now." Kyle Lowry, Toronto Raptors "My go-to music right now is pretty much everything. I've got a good mix of Drake, Jay-Z, Meek Mills, some
      Migos. I've got a good mix of everything. Some R&B. Some old-school R&B. Migos has got some good hype music. It's just good and solid." Jimmy Butler, Minnesota Timberwolves "Favorite song and favorite artist, I bump a lot of Luke Bryan." Draymond
      Green, Golden State Warriors "Mistah F.A.B. He dropped a new album called Thug Tears. That's my go-to right now." Karl-Anthony Towns, Minnesota Timberwolves "It's a lot of everything. It could be Kendrick, J-Cole. I kind of go by the vibes of that
      day. Mac Miller. G-Eazy. It could be anything. I'm a music junkie and I'm always just going with the vibe. I play the music accordingly."</p>
